# Crime Investigation

police and child protection investigations.

## POLE Model

![](http://guides.neo4j.com/sandbox/pole/img/pole_model_visual.jpeg)

The POLE data model focuses on four basic types of entities and the relationships between them: 

- Persons
- Objects
- Locations
- Events

### Use Cases

Graphs are a perfect fit with highly connected data in real time.

- Policing
- Counter Terrorism
- Border Control / Immigration
- Child Protection / Social Services
- Missing Persons
- Offender Rehabilitation
- Insurance Fraud Investigations

### Data

- This demo uses street crime data for Greater Manchester, UK from August 2017.
- it supplies only crime and location data: Locations and Events
- https://data.gov.uk

## Graph Algorithms

### Triangle Count

```sql
CALL algo.triangleCount.stream('Person', 'KNOWS', {concurrency:4})
YIELD nodeId, triangles
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE ID(p) = nodeId AND triangles > 0
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, p.nhs_no AS id, triangles
ORDER BY triangles DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Triangle Count

```sql
MATCH path = (p1:Person {nhs_no: '838-45-9343', surname: 'Ford'})-[:KNOWS]-(p2)-[:KNOWS]-(p3)-[:KNOWS]-(p1)
RETURN path
```

### Triangle Count on a Subgraph

```sql
CALL algo.triangleCount.stream('MATCH (p:Person)-[:PARTY_TO]->(c:Crime) RETURN id(p) AS id', 'MATCH (p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(p2:Person) RETURN id(p1) AS source, id(p2) AS target', {concurrency:4, graph:'cypher'})

MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE ID(p) = nodeId AND
triangles > 0
RETURN p.name AS name, p.surname AS surname, p.nhs_no AS id, triangles
ORDER BY triangles DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Triangle Count on a Subgraph

```sql
